# System Threat Forecasting Unit

A Machine Learning-based system designed to forecast potential system threats based on historical and real-time data. With 76 distinct features and over a thousand data points, this project aims to proactively identify risks and anomalies in system behavior.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Features**: 76 engineered features including system performance metrics, user behavior, access logs, and threat indicators.
- **Rows**: 1000+ records collected from real or simulated environments.
- **Approach**: 
  - Missing value handling
  - Normalization & Standardization
  - Feature selection & dimensionality reduction
  - Machine Learning Algorithm(s) used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost Classifier , XGBoost`
  - Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - Hyperparameter Tuning (Randomized Search CV)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

## 🚀 Features
